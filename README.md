This is a simple side project I did to explore and experiment with different ciphers and hash algorithms.

In its current state, it will only encrypt/decrypt using AES-256, but the hash functions should work although not thoroughly tested.

Since this is a person project meant for learning, encrypting DOES NOT replace the original file.

It will simply use the original file to generate the new encrypted file.
The encrypted file can still be decrypted using the same algorithm and key 
BUT THE ORIGINAL FILE WILL STILL BE THERE ALONG WITH THE ENCRYPTED ONE
